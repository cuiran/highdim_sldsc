1. Change the normalizing steps in Lasso fit from w*X standardize into first centering X and y with weighted means,
    then scale X with L2 norm of centered X
2. Recovering of the coefficients and intercept needs to be changed.
    true coef is simply learned coef divided by X_scale then divide by data.N
    true intercept is weighted mean y minus weighted mean X dot product with true coef times N
